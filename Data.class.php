/**
 * This class contains a single data sturcture for a project.
 * Keep in mind a single project can have multiple data sturctures.
 * A data structure will contain a set of related information all
 * of the same data type (similar to an array). This data will be
 * lumped together into "chunks" of a predetermined size. These
 * chunks will contain n elements each. When a node connects
 * to the server, it will be given k chunks where k is proporitonal
 * to the number of clients currently connected to the server.
 *
 * An example: Lets say you have a list of 2000 prime numbers. You
 * choose a chunk size to be 20. This will create 100 chunks of
 * data each with 20 members. If 5 nodes are currently connected
 * to the server, the server will dish out 20 chunks of data to
 * each node. When one node drops from the server, the 20 chunks it
 * was using will be redistributed to the remaining 4 nodes so that
 * each node receives an extra 5 chunks of data for a total of 25
 * chunks. If at this point another node connects, that node is given
 * 4 'chunks' from each of the current 4 nodes.
